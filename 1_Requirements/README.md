# Introduction: -
Nowadays, real time communication is increasingly rapidly. The popularity of this communication is mostly seen through messages and chats, whether be it personal messages or confidential emails. Thus, there is a need of some protection system which could prevent other party from intruding the privacy of the users. Encrypted Chatbot is such project where two or more authorized users can have chats and messages with no invasion of external party. The chats are encrypted end to end with use of different encryption methods and keys. This is done so as to protect the privacy of people and their messages. For securing of information, it is encrypted before it leaves a user's device and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient. The encrypted message is called as cipher text. For encryption and decryption both the users will require a Key, which might be public or private. The key needs to be created, stored, and offered robust end-to-end secure encryption. Therefore, this project will create texts and keys taking plain texts as input. The algorithm used for encryption is taking number series as a mathematical conversion and storing the secret word in a generated string. Have a safe space for your chats!
